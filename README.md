# DeepSEA

A package for computing the similarity between proteins based on their
ligand binding activity. DeepSEA is based on the Similarity Ensemble
Approach (SEA), where the representation for ligands is learned using
deep neural nets similar to the neural-fingerprint approach. DeepSEA
is implemented in the tensorflow framework.
